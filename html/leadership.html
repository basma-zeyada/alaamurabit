						<br>
						<p>On March 2 2016 Alaa became the youngest appointed High-Level Commissioner on Health and Economic Growth, chaired by the United Nations, World Health Organization (WHO), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Labour Organization (ILO).</p>
						<p>As a Commissioner Alaa has been tasked with stimulating the creation of health and social sector jobs as a means to advance inclusive economic growth, paying specific attention to the needs of low- and lower middle income countries.</p>
						<p>The global economy is projected to create around 40 million new health sector jobs by 2030; mostly in middle- and high- income countries. Despite the anticipated growth in jobs there will be a projected shortage of 18 million health workers to achieve and sustain the Sustainable Development Goals primarily in low and lower-middle income countries. The rising global demand and need for health workers, over the next fifteen years, presents significant challenges. Importantly, it also offers the opportunity to generate employment, in areas where decent jobs are most needed.</p>

							<p>Building on hard-fought, world-changing victories of the international women’s movement, the Everywoman Everywhere Coalition has come together with a singular goal:Mobilization and execution of a global, grassroots-up campaign for a universal legal tool, such as a UN Convention or Additional Protocol, that empowers every woman and girl access to legal remedy should her rights to personal security be violated.

				<p class="inTheNewTxt col-sm-10">Defending reproductive rights nationally and internationally consequently creates a cycle of education, security, and prosperity, be it in resolving food security challenges, countering increasing polarization, or resolving domestic and cross-border conflicts peacefully. Decades of research show that when women are empowered, countries are more secure and more prosperous. None of this happens if a girl’s reproductive rights and educational opportunities remain unprotected.</p>
