High-Level Commissioner, HEALTH & ECONOMIC GROWTH, UNITED NATIONS On March 2 2016 Alaa became the youngest appointed High-Level Commissioner on Health and Economic Growth, chaired by the United Nations, World Health Organization (WHO), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Labour Organization (ILO). As a Commissioner Alaa has been tasked with stimulating the creation of health and social sector jobs as a means to advance inclusive economic growth, paying specific attention to the needs of low- and lower middle income countries. The global economy is projected to create around 40 million new health sector jobs by 2030; mostly in middle- and high- income countries. Despite the anticipated growth in jobs there will be a projected shortage of 18 million health workers to achieve and sustain the Sustainable Development Goals primarily in low and lower-middle income countries.

The grace - the determination - the high humour mixed with high intelligence - the personal heroism, and boundless energy. And every encounter we have had since then confirms my first impression. She is a deeply remarkable woman, fearless and radical, wise and full of wonder at the possibilities of and need for change in the world. I feel there’s nothing she can’t achieve and when you’re with her, it makes you believe that the world can change and together with her we can make that happen. Richard Curtis, SDG Advocate, Producer, Director, Founder “Red Nose Day” I look up to Alaa for many reasons. She is a strong, dynamic powerhouse of a leader, who offers everyone she encounters with the same level of respect. She values good work, but also pushes for great improvement. Finally, she is my friend\/boss\/mentor\/ all in one- I feel lucky to have had this opportunity. Nayana Bijli, former Mentee of Dr. Murabit Alaa is a global leader with an inspiring voice and a truly unique range. Her life experience bridges east and west, science and literature, high-level diplomacy and grassroots peacebuilding. She has vitally important insights that must be heard in our troubled times. Lara Setrakian, founder, NewsDeeply I asked Alaa to become the Executive Director of Phase Minus 1 in 2017 because she is THE most influential leader on Inclusive Security I have ever known. She has consummate knowledge, unbridled commitment, and a unique ability to go from concept to reality regardless of obstacles. General Daniel “Fig” Leaf, Phase Minus 1 I’ve worked with Alaa for over 5 years; I have seen her go from giving speeches to thousands of people to spending weeks with local leaders in remote communities with the same authenticity, commitment and above all, generosity. Alaa is always remembered, wherever she goes, for her ability to inspire with her intelligence, incredible stories and expertise. We have been mentoring emerging leaders and her capacity to motivate them and recognize their potential and enable them to flourish is shared by every single one of our mentees. Christina Myers, Co-founder, Phase Minus 1 Dr. Murabit champions women’s participation in peace processes and conflict mediation. She approaches conflict in a way that humanizes both sides: by first finding common ground. She is helping everyone in the world understand that when women succeed, everyone succeeds. It’s good for the economy, it’s good for the government, and it’s even good for the environment. Lewis Howes, The School of Greatness To say she has succeeded in making both her own voice, and the voices of other young women, heard is an understatement. As an adviser and the chair of a handful of different think tanks and organisations around the world, Alaa contributes daily to young minority women gaining an ever-widening local and global audience that is willing to listen. Margot Wallstrom, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Alaa is a natural leader..her bold thinking and fearless attitude are an inspiration for all women to be the architects of their own future HM Queen Noor She [Alaa Murabit] is an exceptional leader at the forefront of women’s rights Monique Villa, CEO Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, UN Women Executive Director Alaa is a nothing less than a national treasure. She represents the values and fights for all the core principles that make me proud to be Canadian. Alaa for everything! Liz Plank, Executive Producer, VOX Alaa is a true force of nature representing and advocating for the rights of women. She does this with precision, power and grace.
